## Description

This bot made with Bot Framework and LUIS Cognitive Services is still in development. It is aimed to eventually ask users about their habits and categorise them based on their answers. After that It will be able to send messages on how to improve the users health. Through the use of QnA Maker, the bot is able to answer some basic questions about everyday stuff, unrelated to activity coaching, to make it feel more conversational. However the purpose of the bot is to coach the user through his/her day, rather than being just a conversational bot. User data are stored on a database on Azure.

## How to Use

You can check out a preview of the bot, on the [web](https://webchat.botframework.com/embed/ActivityCoachingBot?s=egFHBQNAzoo.z61I-p52hBiAmY2ql9ttxZH4SVhtBQj2ZXgbitJOsoY) or in [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/chat/0/0?users=28:c5fcabaa-6ef2-45c4-b35f-b29048cd044e). Using the above links, a new user id is not given to you, unless you write something first, so try greeting the bot to get to the regular flow. After that you might need to greet the bot again if you would like to enter the questionnaire dialog.
